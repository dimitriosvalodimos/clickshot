# Clickshot

Take screenshots while navigating in your browser

---

## The idea

In an effort to replace ScribeHow I tried my hand at recreating the main feature of the ScribeHow browser extension - taking screenshots while browsing a website using the left-click as a trigger.

## How it works

- provide a project name in the input field (this will be used as the filename for the file download later on)
- click "Start"
- use the website as you normally would
- when you're done, open the extension popup and click "Stop". Given that things worked as planned, you should be downloading a ".zip" file containing all your screenshots

## Extensions have weird data/control flow
